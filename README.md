# Pathfinding-Visualizer

This project is based on Cl√©ment Mihailescu's pathfinding visualizer.  https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer-Tutorial

In his tutorial he provides a MVP pathfinding visualizer with dijkstra's algorithm. I fixed the UI issue he was having with clicking nodes, added some additional functionalities, and overall made it look a lot better.

I chose this project to get more experience in React.  I plan on adding additional algorithms and functionalities in the future.  Feel free to fork this project or copy and paste code.
